 ### Hello there!
 My name is Ifedayo, a data analyst. I'm focused on providing solutions to businesses through advanced analytics. 
 My major interests are in Sales and Marketing, People and Culture, Healthcare and Finance.
 However, I'm open to collaborating on projects in various industries. 
 I make use of tools like Python, R, SQL, Excel, Power BI/Tableau, and version control to analyze large datsets and draw insights. 
 I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects with people. I'm also open to exciting job opportunities.
 Here's a link to my portfolio.
